{"generation":" Okay. So here is um the ventilation in place. After this the eardrum will be intact. Yeah. Okay. So now is for cleaning the ear and suctioning everything. Yeah. So after cleaning and suctioning, suction and cleaning I don't see any any bleeding or any other, okay other, anything. Okay. And the ventilation tube is in place. Thank you. \n\nHere is a structured operative report using nominalization in prose.\n\nOperative Report:\n\nPreparation:\nThe ear was prepared with an ear speculum. The meatus was found to be filled with cerumen, which was subsequently removed.\n\nExploration:\nFollowing cerumen removal, the eardrum was visualized and appeared intact without evidence of infection. A larger ear speculum was then utilized for improved visualization.\n\nIntervention:\nA sickle knife was used to perform an eryngo procedure in the lower aspect of the tympanic membrane. However, an excessive amount of fluid was encountered, necessitating the use of suction. A larger suction tip was employed, facilitating the removal of substantial secretions, ultimately revealing a sterile tympanum.\n\nVentilation Tube Insertion:\nAfter creating an opening, a ventilation tube (gold) was inserted using small ear forceps. The procedure was complicated by the presence of fluid and required correction using a sickle knife.\n\nClosure and Inspection:\nFollowing ventilation tube insertion, the eardrum was confirmed to be intact. The ear was then thoroughly cleaned and suctioned to ensure no bleeding or complications were present.\n\nResult:\nThe procedure resulted in the successful placement of a ventilation tube, with no observed complications or bleeding.\n\nPlease note that if certain terms don't directly translate or seem slightly different (e.g., \"eryngo procedure\" which might not be the standard term but is maintained from the original transcription), they are kept in the spirit of preserving the original operative report's content without adding external information.
