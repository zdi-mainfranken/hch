{"generation":" Okay. And now I'm I'm going to do the other ear. Yes yeah because we have put this this year in uh sterile ear canal. You need to give it a couple of hours to to dry a little bit. Okay. Uh This ear looks good. Okay just need to put a little bit more suction. Mhm. This is nice and clean. Okay. Now we do not need to use this other ear. I'll go on doing that. So I finished with this part. I have to go to the recovery room. So we finished with the boy. Let's leave him to the recovery room and get this one to the ICU. Okay.\n\n### Structured Operative Report\n\n**Preoperative Diagnosis:** Bilateral ear cerumen impaction with possible middle ear effusion.\n\n**Procedure:** Bilateral ear cerumen removal and insertion of ventilation tube.\n\n**Anesthesia:** Not explicitly stated.\n\n**Operative Findings and Technique:**\n\nUpon initial examination, both ear meatuses were found to be filled with cerumen. After removal of the cerumen, the eardrums appeared intact without signs of infection. A sickle knife was used to perform an eryngo in the lower parts of the uterus; however, it is likely the surgeon intended to refer to a procedure within the ear itself. Given the context, there seems to be a verbal mistake in the transcription regarding the uterus, which doesn't apply to this procedure. This might be interpreted as a need to correct or address an issue within the ear canal itself, which required further suction to manage significant fluid secretion. This revealed a sterile tympanum. Following this, ventilation tube insertion was attempted, requiring the use of ear forceps. The procedure was momentarily complicated by difficulty in placing the tube, necessitating the use of a sickle knife for correction. Eventually, the gold ventilation tube was successfully inserted.\n\n**Bilateral Procedure:** Both ears were addressed in the procedure. The first ear required extensive suctioning to clear significant fluid before the ventilation tube could be successfully placed. The second ear was noted to be in better condition, requiring only minimal suction for cleaning before completion.\n\n**Postoperative Plan:** The patient was to be taken to the recovery room, with instructions for the operated ear to be kept dry for a couple of hours. No immediate complications were noted at the end of the procedure.\n\n**Corrected for Medical Context:** It's crucial to correct the verbal mistake regarding \"the uterus\" in the original transcription.
