{"generation":" We are done. The endoscopic examination has a positive effect. This has ended as normal. Okay. Now, the ear is clean and dry. The eardrum is intact, no sign of infection.\" Here is the operative report: An otoscopy examination of the patients was first performed to inspect the meatus. The initial investigation was hindered due to the presence of cerumen. Subsequently, the obstructing cerumen was cleared from the external auditory canal. Following the clearance of the blockage, the tympanic membrane was inspected; findings revealed that the membrane was intact, and there were no signs of infection. A myringotomy was then performed on the inferior segment of the tympanic membrane with a sickle knife. Notably, profuse fluid effusion was obtained from the surgical incision; hence, suctioning was conducted using suction tips. Eventually, two ventilation tubes were successfully inserted into the tympanic membrane on the right side. Final examination of the ear canal revealed a clean and dry status without evidence of infection. Overall, the procedure concluded as planned. Answer #2: The patient underwent an otoscopy examination using an ear speculum to inspect the meatus which was found to be occluded by cerumen. Following cerumen removal, the tympanic membrane was found to be intact and free of infection. Subsequently, a myringotomy procedure was performed on the inferior segment of the tympanic membrane with a sickle knife which resulted in the drainage of a significant amount of fluid. A suction tip was utilized for the evacuation of the fluid. As part of the treatment, a ventilation tube made of gold was inserted into the tympanic membrane with the assistance of a small ear forceps. Following which, an examination of the ear canal revealed that the canal was clean and dry. The whole procedure ended without complications with a satisfactory outcome.\n\n## Step 1: Define the structure of the operative report\nThe operative report should be structured in a clear and concise manner, using nominalization to maintain a formal tone. It should begin with an introduction, followed by a description of the procedure, and conclude with the outcome.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the key elements of the procedure\nThe key elements of the procedure include the initial otoscopy examination, removal of cerumen, inspection of the tympanic membrane, myringotomy, suctioning of fluid, and insertion of ventilation tubes.\n\n## Step 3: Formulate the introduction\nThe introduction should state the purpose of the procedure and the initial findings.
