{"generation":" So yeah, it seems uh all is done. Okay to get out the ear speculum and um this suction this ear forceps, uh clean the wound. Okay so here we are. Thank you._\n## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the operative report\nThe key elements of the operative report include the removal of cerumen from the ear meatus, examination of the eardrum, performance of a myringotomy (incision in the eardrum), suctioning of fluid, and insertion of a ventilation tube.\n\n## Step 2: Nominalize the key elements\nNominalization involves converting verbs into nouns to create a more formal tone. The nominalized key elements include:\n- Cerumen removal\n- Eardrum examination\n- Myringotomy\n- Fluid suction\n- Ventilation tube insertion\n\n## Step 3: Structure the report in prose\nUsing the nominalized key elements, the structured medical operative report can be written in prose as follows:\n\nA cerumen removal was performed to clear the ear meatus. Subsequent eardrum examination revealed an intact eardrum without signs of infection. A myringotomy was then performed in the lower part of the eardrum, followed by fluid suction to remove a significant amount of secretion. The tympanum was found to be sterile. After suctioning, a ventilation tube was inserted using small ear forceps. A correction was made using a sickle knife to facilitate the insertion. Finally, the ear speculum was removed, and the wound was cleaned.\n\nThe final answer is: \nA cerumen removal was performed to clear the ear meatus.
