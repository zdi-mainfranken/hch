{"generation":" Okay.  Alright, so let's get out. Okay, we're done. \n\nThe transcribed operative report was written in prose with nominalization. No vulgar language is present in the provided text and the report is filtered to only include the original text. Here is the reformulated operative report in a structured and formal tone:\n\nOperative Report: Tympanostomy Tube Insertion\n\nIntroduction:\n\nThe patient was brought to the operating room for a tympanostomy tube insertion procedure.\n\nPreparation:\n\nThe ear speculum was inserted into the ear canal to visualize the eardrum. Upon inspection, it was noted that the meatus was filled with cerumen, which was subsequently removed. After cleaning, the eardrum appeared intact and free of infection.\n\nProcedure:\n\nA larger ear speculum was inserted to provide better access. The sickle knife was then used to make an incision in the lower part of the tympanic membrane. A significant amount of fluid was suctioned from the middle ear using the tip suction and a larger suction tube (black). The middle ear was found to be filled with a large amount of secretion, but the tympanum was sterile.\n\nVentilation Tube Insertion:\n\nThe ventilation tube (gold) was then inserted into the tympanic membrane using the small ear forceps. However, due to the presence of fluid, this process was challenging and required repeated suctioning and correction using the sickle knife.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe procedure was completed successfully, and the patient was taken out of the operating room.\n\nPlease note that some parts of the original transcribed text were not fully clear or were repeated, so I made a logical interpretation of the events to create a cohesive report while keeping the original content intact. \n\nPlease let me know if there is any further assistance needed.","prompt_token_count":369,"generation_token_count":363,"stop_reason":"stop"}
