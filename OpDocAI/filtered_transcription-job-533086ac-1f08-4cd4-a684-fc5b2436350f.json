{"generation":" So this was Eryngo in the left ear also with a lot of fluid, no, a lot of fluid to suction. A bit easy on this side. It was a bit easy on left. Easier than the right, yeah. Thank you very much. We're done.\n\n**Structured Operative Report:**\n\n**Procedure:** Bilateral Myringotomy with Ventilation Tube Insertion (Tympanostomy Tube Insertion)\n\n**Preoperative Diagnosis:** Bilateral Otitis Media with Effusion\n\n**Postoperative Diagnosis:** Same as preoperative diagnosis\n\n**Operation:**\n\nThe patient was prepared and positioned for the procedure. The ear speculum was inserted into the left ear canal, revealing a meatus filled with cerumen. The cerumen was removed, and the eardrum was visualized, appearing intact and without signs of infection. A larger ear speculum was then inserted to facilitate better visualization.\n\nA sickle knife was used to perform a myringotomy in the lower part of the tympanic membrane. A significant amount of fluid was suctioned out using a tip suction, and the area was cleaned. The tympanic membrane was then found to be sterile.\n\nA ventilation tube (gold) was inserted into the myringotomy site using small ear forceps. The procedure was repeated on the right ear, where the myringotomy and ventilation tube insertion were performed with similar findings of significant fluid accumulation.\n\nThe left ear procedure was noted to be slightly easier than the right ear. Throughout the procedure, suctioning was required to remove the copious amounts of fluid present in both ears.\n\n**Complications:** None noted during the procedure.\n\n**Conclusion:** The procedure was completed successfully, with the patient receiving bilateral myringotomy with ventilation tube insertion to treat otitis media with effusion. The patient was stable throughout the procedure, and no complications were encountered.","prompt_token_count":369,"generation_token_count":378,"stop_reason":"stop"}
