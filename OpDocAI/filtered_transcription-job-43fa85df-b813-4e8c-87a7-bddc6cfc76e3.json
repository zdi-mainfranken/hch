{"generation":" Uh. I put the right ventilation tube in it right, okay. Now just check it, okay. Now we're just going to close uh it with ear pick. Uh. Yes. Okay. And in the ear drops, right? So a couple of drops right there. Thank you very much. Uh That's a whole. Here is the operation report based on the transcribed operative report:\n\nOperative Report\n\nPre-Operative Diagnosis: \nImpacted earwax, serous otitis media\n\nOperation: \nCerumen extraction, tympanostomy tube insertion\n\n Anesthesia and Positioning: \nLocal Anesthetics, ENT surgery position\n\nIncision: \nEar meatus canal\n\n Procedure: \n The operative procedure started with the use of ear speculum of an appropriate size. A cerumenectomy then followed, with the employment of an ear pick. After removing the cerumen, the tympanic membrane appeared intact and free of infection. A bigger ear speculum was put in place. An Eryngo of the lower segment of the eardrum was performed. Ventilation tube suction was followed with employment of low-pressure ventilation tube suction. There was an excessive amount of fluid in the mid-ear. A section in the anterior inferior quadrant of the eardrum was done. Then the secretion in the mid-ear was suctioned out. A sterile tympanum was revealed. Ventilation tube insertion then followed, and a gold tube was placed under direct visualization with endoscopy assistance and the employment of small ear forceps. An attempt to correct the eardrum was made, facilitated by the employment of a sickle knife.\n\n The middle ear space was then ventilated with ventilation tubes. \nClosure and Postoperative Care: \n Closure was accomplished with ear drops, and postoperative care instructions were relayed.\n\n Operative Findings: \n The ear canal contained a lot of cerumen. There was an excessive amount of fluid in the mid-ear.\n\nPost-Operative Complications: \n None recorded. \n\n**END**","prompt_token_count":369,"generation_token_count":416,"stop_reason":"stop"}
